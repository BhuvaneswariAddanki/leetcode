/**
 * Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.
 * <p>
 * In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: num = 14
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
 * Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
 * Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
 * Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
 * Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
 * Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: num = 8
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
 * Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
 * Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
 * Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: num = 123
 * Output: 12
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 0 <= num <= 106
 * <p>

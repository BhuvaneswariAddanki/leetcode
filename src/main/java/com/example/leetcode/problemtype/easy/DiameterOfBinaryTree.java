/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
 * <p>
 * The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
 * <p>
 * The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [1,2]
 * Output: 1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 * <p>
